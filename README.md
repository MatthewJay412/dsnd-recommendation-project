# DSND Recommendation Project

This notebook walks through building a full recommendation engine using IBM Watson Studio data. You’ll see three flavors of recommendations—popularity (rank‑based), collaborative filtering (user–user and SVD), and content‑based (TF‑IDF + K‑Means clustering). By the end, you’ll have functions that recommend articles for brand‑new users, users with sparse history, and users with rich interaction logs.

## Getting Started

To grab a copy of the project and run it locally, just clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatthewJay412/dsnd-recommendation-project.git
cd dsnd-recommendation-project/starter
jupyter notebook Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb
```

### Dependencies
